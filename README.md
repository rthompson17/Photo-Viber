Photo Viber is a simple full stack MERN application created to help people choose better photos for their dating app profiles. Users rate photos as "good vibes" or "bad vibes" and can upload their own photos to be rated.


# User Signup 

![PV_signup](https://catcollector-ry.s3.amazonaws.com/pv_signup.png) 

Users can sign up to create a new account and upload a profile photo. Once signed up, they can view other user images to rate, and they can also upload their own images for other user to review.

# Rating an Image
To rate an image, users can either swipe the photo left for "bad vibes" or right for "good vibes." They can also click the buttons underneath the image and the card will animate a "swipe" motion either to the left or right.

# Likes Counter from Swipe 
When a user swipes right on an image or clicks the "good vibes" button on another user's photo, that user will be able to see that they're received a new like on that image.

This will later be expanded to more detailed feedback based on the buttons on the main review page.


# Next Steps
This app is currently a work in progress! Future modifications include:

- Breaking down the review options into more detailed feedback on each image
- Creating a social or chat element to the app so that users can communicate with one another
- Possibly expanding the app's functionality into a full dating app
