Photo Viber is a full stack MERN application created to help people choose better photos for their dating app profiles. Users can upload photos to be reviewed, and can also review the photos of other users.

Users can sign up to create a new account and upload a profile photo. Once signed up, they can view other user images to review, and they can also upload their own images for other user to review.

Images will soon be able to be rated using the buttons below the image, but this feature is still in development. In the meantime, users can "like" the images by browsing the image cards below the main swipe image deck.

Users can see how many "likes" they've received on each image. This will later be expanded to more detailed feedback based on the buttons on the main review page.
